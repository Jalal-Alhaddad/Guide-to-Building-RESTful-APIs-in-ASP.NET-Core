# Data

**Data** is a collection of discrete and unorganized facts, statistics, or information that, on its own, may lack context and meaning. Data can be in the form of individual bits or bytes, and it is typically represented electronically or on physical media.

 **Information Technology** encompasses the use of computers, software, hardware, networks, and other technologies to process, store, transmit, and manage *data*. It involves a wide range of activities, including data collection, storage, retrieval, analysis, and communication. Information Technology is essential in modern society for a multitude of applications, from managing business operations to enabling communication and entertainment.

## Data Storage

**Data Storage** refers to the process of storing and preserving data, which can be in various forms, for future use, retrieval, and reference. Data storage is a critical component of information management, ensuring that data is accessible, secure, and available when needed.

## Data Storage types

The two main types of data storage are file storage and database storage:

### File Storage

File storage involves the storage of data in files, which are typically organized in directories or folders on a file system. These files can contain various types of data, including text, images, videos, documents, and more.

Characteristics:

- Typically used for unstructured or semi-structured data.
- Data is stored in individual files, often with various formats and extensions.
- Provides flexibility in managing and organizing data.
- Commonly used for content like documents, images, multimedia, and archives.
- Suitable for situations where data doesn't need complex querying and relational structures.

Examples: Local computer hard drives.

### Database Storage

Database storage involves the organized and structured storage of data within a database management system (DBMS). Data is stored in tables, rows, and columns, and it can be of various types, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

Characteristics

- Ideal for structured data that can be organized into tables with predefined schemas.
- Supports complex queries, indexing, and data relationships.
- Ensures data consistency, integrity, and security.
- Suitable for transactional and analytical data processing.

Examples: Relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).
