# Web Api

## API (Application Programming Interface)

An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. APIs are used for various purposes, such as accessing web services, interacting with databases, and enabling third-party developers to integrate with a platform or service.

## Web API

A Web API is an API specifically designed for interaction over the web. It allows different software applications or systems to communicate and exchange data over HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), which is the standard protocol used for the World Wide Web. Web APIs are commonly used to enable communication between a client (e.g., a web application or mobile app) and a server, where the server provides data and services that the client can request and consume.

## REST API (Representational State Transfer API)

REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications. A REST API is an API that adheres to the principles and constraints of REST. These principles include using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for communication, being stateless, having a uniform and consistent interface, and using resources that are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). REST APIs are designed to be simple, scalable, and easily understandable. They are widely used for web services, as they provide a clear and efficient way to access and manipulate resources over the web.
